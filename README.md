This exercise was made only for practise with User API and Recipe API, and API first + fetch with js structure.
The platform is not finished yet, for now the only things was implemented are Login and register with user API and token refresh and auth (and all the validate, user input verify, error manage during registration and login), cards list section with recipe API.
