Simple dashboard with only one function available for now: the cards section. You can create cards with details, create a list of elements in each card, and update them whenever you want. This exercise was made only to practice with the User API and Recipe API, following an API-first approach and using fetch in a JS structure. The platform is not finished yet; for now, the only things implemented are:

Login and registration with the User API, including token refresh and authentication (with all validation, user-input verification, and error handling during registration and login).
Cards-list section with the Recipe API.
